# HealthStat Hospital Efficiency Dashboard
### Domain: Healthcare Analytics  
### Platform: Power BI  
### Focus: Operational Efficiency & Cost Optimization  

## 1. Overview
The HealthStat Hospital Efficiency Dashboard analyzes operational and financial performance across New York hospitals using more than 27,000 inpatient discharge records. The purpose of this project is to identify patterns in Length of Stay (LOS), hospital costs, severity mix, and discharge outcomes.  

The dashboard is designed for executive decision-makers to quickly identify efficiency gaps, analyze cost drivers, and benchmark facilities across the network.

## 2. Project Goals
- Identify key drivers of long Length of Stay (LOS)
- Analyze cost variation between facilities
- Benchmark hospitals against system-wide averages
- Build an automated recommendation engine for facility profiling
- Deliver a clean, intuitive Power BI dashboard for real-time insights

## 3. Dashboard Pages
### **Page 1 — Executive Overview**
High-level metrics:
- Total Admissions: 27K  
- Avg Length of Stay: 2.67 days  
- Avg Cost per Stay: $20.99K  

Visuals include Key Influencers, severity distribution, and efficiency scatter plots.

### **Page 2 — LOS Comparison**
- LOS Efficiency Score  
- LOS by Severity/County  
- Top & Bottom LOS facilities  

### **Page 3 — Cost Comparison**
- Total Charges: $89.83M  
- Total Costs: $35.75M

- Automated recommendations (DAX SWITCH)

## 4. Key Insights
- LOS variation indicates bottlenecks in certain facilities  
- High cost influenced by severity, diagnosis, and specific counties  
- Revenue structure inconsistencies shown through CTC ratios  
- Age group 70+ strongly influences LOS and cost  

## 5. Recommendations
Operational:
- Improve discharge workflow efficiency  

Financial:
- Investigate cost outliers in low-severity groups  

Quality:
- Strengthen care for severe/extreme cases  

Technology:
- Implement predictive models for LOS forecasting  

## 6. Outcome
The dashboard transforms raw data into actionable insights, enabling leadership to optimize hospital operations, reduce costs, and improve care delivery.
